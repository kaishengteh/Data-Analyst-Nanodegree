This repository contains projects for Udacity's [Data Analyst Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-analyst-nanodegree--nd002).

### Part 1: Analyze Bay Area Bike Share Project
Complete your first project analyzing bike rental data. It’s a great project to tackle during the first week in your Nanodegree to see if the program is a good fit for you!

- Project: [Analyze Bay Area Bike Share Data](https://github.com/kaishengteh/Data-Analyst-Nanodegree/blob/master/1-Analyze-Bay-Area-Bike-Share-Project/Bay_Area_Bike_Share_Analysis.ipynb)

### Part 2: [Descriptive Statistics](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-descriptive-statistics--ud827)
Learn to use descriptive statistics to describe properties of datasets and learn about how samples and populations are related.

### Part 3: [Intro to Data Analysis](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-data-analysis--ud170)
Choose one of Udacity's curated datasets and investigate it using NumPy and Pandas. Go through the entire data analysis process, starting by posing a question and finishing by sharing your findings.

- Project: [Investigate a Dataset](https://github.com/kaishengteh/Data-Analyst-Nanodegree/blob/master/3-Intro-to-Data-Analysis/Investigate-a-Dataset.ipynb)

### Part 4: [Data Wrangling](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-wrangling-with-mongodb--ud032)
Choose a region of the world from www.openstreetmap.org and then use data wrangling techniques to audit and clean the data. You'll then use a database to query the cleaned data.

- Project: [Wrangle OpenStreetMap Data](https://github.com/kaishengteh/Data-Analyst-Nanodegree/blob/master/4-Data-Wrangling/Data_Wrangling.ipynb)

### Part 5: [Exploratory Data Analysis](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-analysis-with-r--ud651)
Use R and apply exploratory data analysis techniques to explore a selected data set for distributions, outliers, and relationships.

- Project: [Explore and Summarize Data](https://cdn.rawgit.com/kaishengteh/Data-Analyst-Nanodegree/e94db549/5-Exploratory-Data-Analysis/Exploratory%20Data%20Analysis.html)

### Part 6: [Inferential Statistics](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-inferential-statistics--ud201)
Use descriptive statistics and a statistical test to analyze the Stroop effect, a classic result of experimental psychology.

- Project: [Test a Perceptual Phenomenon](https://github.com/kaishengteh/Data-Analyst-Nanodegree/blob/master/6-Inferential-Statistics/Stroop-Effect.ipynb)

### Part 7: [Intro to Machine Learning](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-machine-learning--ud120)
Play detective and put your machine learning skills to use by building an algorithm to identify Enron Employees who may have committed fraud based on the public Enron financial and email dataset.
